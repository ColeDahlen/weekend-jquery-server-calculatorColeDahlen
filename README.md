# Server Calculator
## Description
Duration: Weekend solo project

This project function was to take two input fields values, and either add, subtract, multiply, or divide. It would then figure out the answer server side and send back to client the answer. The client would then render the history of the equations, and update an HTML element of the latest answer.
## Problems I Ran Into
The problems I ran into along the way was getting the object to send over correctly. I fixed this issue by changing some of the syntax, and testing more granularly.
## What I Did Well
I think I was able to update my array of objects really well, and could deferentiate which operator was clicked and put that into my function correctly.
